# Online Over-Sharer

**Category:** OSINT
**Target:** `jenna_and_blue` on Instagram

## TL;DR

Jenna posts a lot about her dog. Like, a lot. Turns out "a lot" is exactly the vulnerability class this challenge is testing — her security questions can basically all be answered by scrolling her feed for five minutes.

## The Approach

Instead of trying to brute-force anything, I just went full stalker-with-good-intentions and read through `jenna_and_blue`'s posts like a normal nosy person would. Between the captions, hashtags, and photo timestamps, pretty much every "security" question had already been answered publicly, sometimes multiple times over.

## What I Found

**Post 1 — puppy photo, dated 5/18/2018** Caption spells it all out in a numbered list (thanks Jenna):

- Blue is a **basset hound**
- Blue has **2 brothers**
- Blue is watching her graduation in **June** from **grandma's house**
- `#classof2026`

**Post 2 — campus view** A shot looking out over a Mission Revival–style building (tower with arched windows, red tile roof), confirming grad year `#2026`. The building itself took a bit more digging — landed on **Kenna Hall** based on the tower architecture matching that cluster of buildings near the Mission Gardens.

**Post 3 — Blue looking sad** Confirms `#classof2026` again for good measure, plus the general "Blue's Clues" connection that pointed at the voice-actor question (Magenta → **Koyalee Chanda**).
